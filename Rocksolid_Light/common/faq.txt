q: what is this ?
a: it is a node of the rocksolid forums.
The rocksolid forums are technically some news
servers running private newsgroups together and offering web frontends
for user access. the intention is to have redundant web forums, which
are always up and reachable in a way.
a2: some nodes may carry other groups, including common usenet groups.

q: what are the tos ?
a: don't irritate the admins. they/we run these sites because we want
to. Don't troll, post crap, illegal stuff, and it should be fine.

q: will you tolerate links to cp ?
a: no (see above).

q: why do you use stoneage technology ?
a1: because it's fun.
a2: because it saves you (the user) and me (the admin) from some
security holes the newer stuff brings with it (having said that, of
course there are security holes in the old stuff as well...)
a3: because it handles the job well (even on old hardware and minimal
systems)

q: what do i do when this node is down or unreachable ?
a: use any other rocksolid site, they all carry the same message base
(and some of them other groups as well, like usenet, dovenet or freenet
groups).

q: i discovered a piece of information that should not be here. what do
i do ?
a: ask in rocksolid.nodes.help for the admin of the node you are using 
and how to contact them.
a2: For novabbs or rocksolidbbs, email admin@novabbs.com

q: what is the point of all of this ?
a: it's free anonymous speech, and the fun of running a service that
supports it.

q: can i run my own node ?
a: sure you can. it is easier then it might look. contact us in the
rocksolid.shared.rocksolid group.
